# [Graphile Worker](https://github.com/graphile/worker) for [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)

> Job queue for PostgreSQL running on Node.js - allows you to run jobs (e.g. sending emails, performing calculations, generating PDFs, etc) "in the background" so that your HTTP response/application code is not held up. Can be used with any PostgreSQL-backed application. Pairs beautifully with [PostGraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/) or [PostgREST](http://postgrest.org/).
